Here’s the concise summary of recent (past 14 days) Tunisian fishing conditions, sourced from the listed search results:  

- **Currently active fish species:**  
  Sardines, Bluefish (Mackerel), Red Mullet (*Mullus barbatus*), and Octopus dominate catches. Bluefish and Sardines are most actively reported, likely due to seasonal inshore migrations. [Source: FishAngler (2025 catch reports)]  

- **Prime fishing locations:**  
  Kerkennah Islands and the Djerba Channel remain top spots due to nutrient-rich currents attracting migratory species. Coastal reefs off Cap Bon and the Gulf of Gabès also show increased activity. [Sources: Fishingreminder (2025 charts), FishAngler hotspots].  

- **Recent catches:**  
  Fishers near Kerkennah reported large Sardine and Bluefish hauls in mid-coastal zones, while Red Mullet clusters were noted in shallower waters around Djerba. Octopus catches peaked during evening tides in reef-lined areas. [Sources: FishAngler user logs, Tunisian fisheries data].  

- **Fishing trends:**  
  Solunar tables (source 2) rate fishing activity "fair" (score: 24/100) this week, with best results during dawn/dusk or pre-cold front periods. Weather conditions (source 5) align with these timing windows.  

*Note: Catches remain below historical levels (source 4), but migratory species are still localized in key areas.*
