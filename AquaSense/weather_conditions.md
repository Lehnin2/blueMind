Here is the requested analysis based on recent data (past 14 days):

- **Sea Temperatures**:  
  Major coastal areas like Tunis report **19.1°C to 19.8°C**, consistent with seasonal averages for late autumn. Slight regional variations reflect coastal microclimates (Sources 1, 4).  

- **Marine Forecasts**:  
  Over the next **15 days**, forecasts predict **NW winds (Force 4, 20–28 km/h) with evening gusts up to 23 knots (Source 2). Minimal precipitation, but evening wind shifts may disrupt anchoring stability. Increased swell (1–1.5m) in open waters mid-afternoon (Source 3.  

- **Wave & Tidal Conditions**:  
  Waves remain **calm (<1m) in most coastal zones**, with **southward swell (1–1.5m) in open seas. Tidal ranges average **0.6–1.2m daily**, with peak high tides at midday (Source 3. Current tidal patterns pose no unusual navigation risks.  

- **Visibility & Hazards**:  
  Excellent daytime visibility (10+ km) is frequent, but evening wind gusts may cause short, choppy swells in sheltered harbors (Source 2. Caution advised for small craft in unprotected areas during gusty periods.  

All data synthesized from **MeteoConsult forecasts**, tide-forecast.com, and Tunisian coastal monitoring stations.
