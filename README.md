# AquaSense – Smart Fish Identification & Marine Anomaly Detection

## Overview

AquaSense is an AI-powered platform for smart fish detection, species recognition, size and weight estimation, freshness and toxicity analysis, and marine anomaly detection. It also features a conversational chatbot that responds to marine-related queries in Tunisian dialect.

Built using a client-server architecture, AquaSense integrates computer vision, keypoint detection, and natural language processing to deliver a complete marine AI solution via a React Native frontend and FastAPI backend.

## Features

### 🐟 Fish Detection & Classification
- **Detectron2** for high-precision segmentation and classification.
- **YOLOv8s** optimized for mobile use.
- **Faster-RCNN (ResNet-50 FPN)** for challenging underwater environments.
- **YOLOv11s** for enhanced real-time performance in dynamic scenes.

### 📏 Fish Length, Size & Weight Estimation
- **YOLOv8n-Pose** for keypoint-based measurement (e.g., head-to-tail).
- **Tunisian Coin-Based Scaling** for converting pixel lengths to real-world sizes.
- **Random Forest Regressor** to predict fish weight from species and length.

### 🧊 Fish Freshness & Toxicity Detection
- **YOLOv8n** to assess freshness from visual features.
- **MobileNetV2** to classify toxic vs. non-toxic species.

### 🤖 Conversational AI Assistant – BlueMind Chatbot
- Based on **Deep Attention Matching (DAM)** architecture.
- Responds to questions on:
  - Fishing techniques
  - Species identification
  - Weather conditions
  - Legal and conservation topics

### 🔍 Smart Search for Protected & Invasive Species
- **Multi-Agent System** for name recognition and correction.
- **Groq AI + FAISS** for semantic search and matching.
- Integrates **YouTube API** and biodiversity data for:
  - Biological status (protected/invasive)
  - Cooking and educational videos
